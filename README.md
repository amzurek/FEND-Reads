# MyReads Project

 This is an app where you can sort books into different shelves based on if you have read them or you want to read them later.

## How it works:

To get started:

* clone this repository
* go to this folder by terminal
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* then will be opened 'localhost:3000'

## What next:

* create profiles to share books
* create place for comments and rating
